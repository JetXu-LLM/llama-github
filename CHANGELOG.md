## [0.1.3] - 2024-10-14

### Added
- Modified `LLMManager` class to skip loading embedding and reranker models when `simple_mode` is enabled
- Updated `retrieve_context` method to use instance's `simple_mode` by default, with option to override

### Improved
- Faster initialization process when `simple_mode` is enabled, skipping embedding and reranker model loading
- More flexible usage of `simple_mode` in `retrieve_context`, allowing per-call customization

### Developer Notes
- When using `simple_mode=True` during GithubRAG initialization, be aware that embedding and reranking functionalities will not be available
- The `retrieve_context` method now uses a late binding approach for `simple_mode` parameter

## [0.1.2] - 2024-10-09

### Added
- New `get_pr_content` method in `Repository` class for comprehensive PR data retrieval
- Singleton pattern implementation for efficient PR data caching
- Support for LLM-assisted PR analysis and Q&A capabilities
- Automatic caching mechanism to reduce API calls and improve performance
- Threaded comment and review retrieval functionality

### Changed
- Improved PR data fetching process to include metadata, file changes, and comments

### Optimized
