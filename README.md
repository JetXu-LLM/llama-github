Llama-github is a powerful tool that helps you retrieve(based on Agentic RAG) the most relevant code snippets, issues, and repository information from GitHub based on your queries, transforming them into valuable knowledge context. It empowers LLM Chatbots, AI Agents, and Auto-dev Agents to solve complex coding tasks. Whether you're a developer looking for quick solutions or an engineer implementing advanced Auto Dev AI Agents, llama-github makes it easy and efficient.

If you like this project or believe it has potential, please give it a ‚≠êÔ∏è. Your support is our greatest motivation!

## Architecture
![High Level Architecture](./docs/high_level_architecture.drawio.svg)

## Installation
```
pip install llama-github
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use llama-github:

```python
from llama_github import GithubRAG

# Initialize GithubRAG with your credentials
github_rag = GithubRAG(
    github_access_token="your_github_access_token", 
    openai_api_key="your_openai_api_key", # Optional in Simple Mode
    jina_api_key="your_jina_api_key" # Optional - unless you want high concurrency production deployment (s.jina.ai API will be used in llama-github)
)

# Retrieve context for a coding question (simple_mode is default set to False)
query = "How to create a NumPy array in Python?"
context = github_rag.retrieve_context(
    query, # In professional mode, one query will take nearly 1 min to generate final contexts. You could set log level to INFO to monitor the retrieval progress
    # simple_mode = True
)

print(context)
```

For more advanced usage and examples, please refer to the [documentation](docs/usage.md).
